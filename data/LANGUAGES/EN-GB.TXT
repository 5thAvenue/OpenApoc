This represents a considerable threat to X-COM because the cultists will do anything to assist the Aliens in their purpose, whatever that might be."
STR_MARSEC = "MarSec"
STR_MARSEC_INFO = "The ominous and highly secretive Marsec corporation took over from X-COM as the leading provider of off-world security, as X-COM centered its activities around Mega-Primus. During the initial years of their operation Marsec was empowered to impose order on the rebellious Mars colony. Marsec (Mars Security) developed high technology weaponry and vehicles by recruiting top Scientists from Earth and using the equipment left by X-COM. With the establishment of the remote Elerium mining colonies, Marsec secured contracts for military equipment despite competition from Megapol."
STR_SUPERDYNAMICS = "Superdynamics"
STR_SUPERDYNAMICS_INFO = "The refinement of Elerium powered anti-grav propulsion units has created a new industry for ecologically friendly power sources. Superdynamics has developed sophisticated plants for producing power units of all sizes as well as a variety of airborne anti-grav vehicles. The cost of manufacture is high and Elerium is also in short supply. This means that privately owned vehicles are rare, but  Superdynamics developed and installed the anti-grav system for the People Tubes. These safe and efficient tube ways rapidly became the mass transit system for Mega-Primus in direct competition to the road network."
STR_GENERAL_METRO = "General Metro"
STR_GENERAL_METRO_INFO = "The General Metro corporation designs and manufactures road vehicles. Since the corporation installed an efficient anti-grav system inside the road structure it became possible to produce low powered anti-grav road vehicles which were cheap and efficient, despite being limited to the road system. The vehicle designs were based on the exuberant styling of the 1950s according to the requirements of city planners. General Metro is a major competitor to Superdynamics, as both corporations provide transport systems."
STR_CYBERWEB = "Cyberweb"
STR_CYBERWEB_INFO = "The Cyberweb corporation developed artificial life forms to provide a willing and obedient workforce for the future. However, popular protest against unemployment forced the Senate to pass laws against artificial life. No more Androids could be built and they were banned from employment except the most menial and degrading jobs. Cyberweb had to change strategy and compete with the Nanotech corporation for medical and military contracts. The unfortunate Androids were either banished from the city or had to be bought and sold as household servants or pets. Androids are good for combat, although they possess no Psionic abilities, and the few that remain may well risk seeking employment by X-COM and join the battle against the Aliens."
STR_TRANSTELLAR = "Transtellar"
STR_TRANSTELLAR_INFO = "The Transtellar corporation owns the Space Port and many of the Space Liners that ship to the city. They also own many warehouses spread throughout the city which are used by many corporations involved in importing and exporting. The city goods transport service and the taxi service are owned and run by Transtellar. The corporation has been regarded suspiciously by Megapol which considers the corporation susceptible to Alien contamination."
STR_SOLMINE = "Solmine"
STR_SOLMINE_INFO = "The discovery of Elerium sources in distant solar systems has produced a new gold rush. The Solmine corporation owns most of the mining operations and it imports Elerium directly to Mega-Primus. These mining operations sustain the economies of the numerous small colonies, but they are still governed from Earth. There have been demands for independence and some rebellions. Major corporations, fearing diminished profits and raised Elerium prices have suppressed these revolts with the aid of Solmine and Marsec."
STR_SENSOVISION = "Sensovision"
STR_SENSOVISION_INFO = "The entertainment industry entered a new phase with the advent of Psionic projectors. Actors connected to Psionic sensors can record their thoughts and experiences in any environment. The recorded patterns are edited into 'Sensovision'  experiences and replayed at 'Sensodromes' where many people can connect to Psionic receivers. The receiver allows people to see, hear, feel and smell what the actor experienced. Sensoviosion actors are wealthy celebrities and the Sensovision corporation is now selling the expensive receiver sets into peoples homes. The only competition comes from the addictive and illegal Psionic implant known as Psiclone, which is supplied by the criminal syndicates."
STR_LIFETREE = "Lifetree"
STR_LIFETREE_INFO = "The Lifetree corporation runs the city schools and universities. They have developed a controversial but highly effective Psionic tutoring system which imparts knowledge far more efficiently than reading or listening to lecturers. If the student resists the knowledge transfer then pain results. Lifetree have been accused of brainwashing since the introduction of the 'moral education' program which is designed to turn the youth into model citizens. They are competing with Sensovision in the production of Psionic devices."

Nanotech also produce the highly effective Medi-Kits used in military combat which use Nanobots to perform battlefield surgery and tissue repair."
STR_ENERGEN = "Energen"
STR_ENERGEN_INFO = "Energen builds power stations which use fusion power cells to generate energy. This is an alternative but cheaper large scale power system than equivalent Elerium units. However, the corporation is wary of attempts by Solmine to create cheaper Elerium energy systems. This can only be achieved by lowering the price of Elerium which could happen if the rebellious mining colonies are totally subdued."
STR_SYNTHEMESH = "Synthemesh"
STR_SYNTHEMESH_INFO = "Manufacturing is largely automated but the ideas for new products still come from human designers. Synthemesh employs many designers to keep generating the latest fashions which fuel consumer demand. The manufacturing plants produce mostly consumer durables, but the corporation also controls a fleet of construction vehicles which are used to build or repair the city infrastructure."
STR_GRAVBALL_LEAGUE = "GravBall League"
STR_GRAVBALL_LEAGUE_INFO = "GravBall is a fast paced aerial version of Soccer where the players use anti-grav backpacks to fly around an immense stadium. Due to the fast and violent nature of the game, players wear tough armor, injuries are still common though. Cybernetic implants are used to substitute for mangled limbs, but a GravBall player must be at least 50% original human flesh in order to qualify in the GravBall league. Due to the popularity of the sport the GravBall League, which owns all the stadiums in the city, has become a prosperous corporation. However, alternative recreations such as Sensovision or the illegal Psiclone are proving to be serious competition."
STR_PSYKE = "Psyke"
STR_PSYKE_INFO = "Psyke is a criminal syndicate which is based in the slum areas. The organization is originally thought to have developed the Psiclone implant in 2081 with the aid of a renegade Marsec scientist. The design was quickly copied by the other syndicates creating an unprecedented level of gang warfare. The degradation of city life is frequently blamed on Psyke's activities, but they are no longer the biggest gang in the region."
STR_DIABLO = "Diablo"
STR_DIABLO_INFO = "Diablo is a criminal syndicate with a particularly violent reputation. They have muscled in on the Psiclone trade and have consequently become bigger and more powerful than Psyke. Gang members are intensely loyal to their cause and hostile to any outsiders."
STR_OSIRON = "Osiron"
STR_OSIRON_INFO = "The Osiron syndicate is the wealthiest criminal operation in the city area. Although they are based in the slum areas they are able to conduct apparently legitimate business in the city and there is no proven link between Osiron and violent crime. It is widely suspected that they employ the services of the other gangs where possible, only resorting to direct action if necessary."
STR_SENTIENT_ENGINE_LIBERATION_FRONT = "Sentient Engine Liberation Front"
STR_SENTIENT_ENGINE_LIBERATION_FRONT_INFO = "The city edict of 2076 effectively banished Androids from most areas of city life. They were forced into slum areas and treated as little more than vermin. They considered themselves to be artificial life forms of equal intellect to human beings and decided to fight back. SELF is an organization dedicated to fight for equality for all sentient life forms, whether flesh or machine. Their activity has been limited to pressure group politics, but there are demands within their ranks to resort to more direct, violent action."
STR_MUTANT_ALLIANCE = "Mutant Alliance"
STR_MUTANT_ALLIANCE_INFO = "The first wave of Alien incursions resulted in many genetic experiments involving crossbreeding humans and the Alien species known as Sectoids. These hybrids have survived in human society, but they have been denied the right to procreate within the city. They also suffer discrimination in employment and education. Although they are genetically almost identical to humans, they retain some Alien facial characteristics and are renowned (and distrusted) for their Psionic abilities. Hybrids Psionic abilities may well prove useful to X-COM in the war against the Aliens. The Mutant Alliance is active in city politics and promotes the concerns of the hybrid community."
STR_EXTROPIANS = "Extropians"
STR_EXTROPIANS_INFO = "The Extropians are one of the city's major political organizations that dominate the Senate. The Extropian philosophy is basically a faith in a bright technological future - a brave new world free of disease, pollution, old age and dull aesthetics. They pioneered the city regulations governing the future-retro styling of the architecture and vehicles. They have strong support from Solmine, Marsec and the larger corporations."
STR_TECHNOCRATS = "Technocrats"
STR_TECHNOCRATS_INFO = "Politically the Technocrat's philosophy is really no different to the Extropians, except they are a little less colorful and more skeptical of technological solutions to social problems. They believe in a structured and ordered society which rigidly adheres to laws and punishes corruption. They draw most support from the smaller corporations and the populations of the mining colonies."
STR_BRAINSUCKER_POD = "Brainsucker Pod"
STR_BRAINSUCKER_POD_INFO = "The pod has a hard and extremely tough skin, this peels back in the presence of human beings. A creature popularly referred to as a "Brainsucker" then emerges fully formed and active. Our conclusion is that these pods are a genetically engineered device designed to attack only human life forms."

STR_BRAINSUCKER_POD_AUTOPSY_INFO = "No autopsy available."
STR_BRAINSUCKER = "Brainsucker"
STR_BRAINSUCKER_INFO = "The life span of a Brainsucker is very short, eight hours at most. It has no reproduction or feeding system. Instead it attacks human victims by grasping the head with its claws and inserting its proboscis into the victims throat. The Brainsucker dies immediately after a successful attack, but our tests reveal that the victim is subsequently transformed into an Alien controlled entity. We will not understand the mechanism which causes this until we have completed studies on the full Alien life cycle."
STR_BRAINSUCKER_AUTOPSY = "Brainsucker Autopsy"
STR_BRAINSUCKER_AUTOPSY_INFO = "This life form appears to have a simple structure with no distinguishable organs apart from an efficient heart and cardiovascular system. There appears to be no means of ingesting food or separate brain structure rendering it immune from Psionic influence. It seems that this creature has little purpose in life except that it is known to attack humans and seems to be designed to do only that. Its complex organic structure may be useful for developing toxins to counter any threat to our race."
STR_MULTIWORM_EGG = "Multiworm Egg"
STR_MULTIWORM_EGG_INFO = "The gestation period for a Multiworm is approximately two days. During this time the egg will protect itself with a weapon that launches a fluid containing micro-organisms. These organisms consist of various types, some containing acids designed to erode metallic compounds and others containing unusual enzymes that rapidly break down organic matter. Fortunately the range of this weapon is limited. The Alien embryos are not sufficiently advanced to be susceptible to Psionic attacks."
STR_MULTIWORM_EGG_AUTOPSY = "Multiworm Egg Autopsy"
STR_MULTIWORM_EGG_AUTOPSY_INFO = "A large worm-like creature quickly develops inside the protective skin of the Alien egg. This worm appears to contain the embryos of a further four life forms. We cannot tell how the next stage in the life cycle develops from the autopsy results, but the tissues will be useful for our toxicology research."
STR_MULTIWORM = "Multiworm"
STR_MULTIWORM_INFO = "The Multiworm is clearly a crucial stage in the complex Alien life cycle. It is capable of attacking by propelling a fluid from pores along the side of the body containing a complex mix of micro-organisms that use enzymes and acids to break down the molecular structure of the target. Fortunately the range of the propellant is fairly short. The Multiworm is slow moving, but care should be taken in combat because it may release its offspring in the throes of death, creating an even greater threat."
STR_MULTIWORM_AUTOPSY = "Multiworm Autopsy"
STR_MULTIWORM_AUTOPSY_INFO = "This creature is a rapacious carnivore whose feeding frenzy contributes to the rapid growth of younger lifeforms called "Hyperworms" which are reared inside its body. The gestation period for the Hyperworms is about three days and each Multiworm gives birth to four offspring. The birth process is lethal for the parent - the Hyperworms explode from the Multiworms body and consume it within a matter of seconds. The brain structure of the Multiworm is undeveloped and it is unlikely to be affected by Psionic attacks. The tissue analysis from the autopsy will provide an invaluable contribution to our biological warfare research."
STR_HYPERWORMS = "Hyperworms"
STR_HYPERWORMS_INFO = "Our studies show that the Hyperworms can consume large quantities of both organic and metallic matter. Its powerful jaws can also be used in close combat. It has a very high metabolic rate and can move at fast speeds with a snake-like action. It has a short life span and only lives for two to five days depending on how much food it can find. At the end of this feeding period it finds a safe place and suddenly inflates into a balloon like structure which is fixed firmly to its surrounding terrain. This structure appears to be some form of Chrysalis, inside which another life form begins to grow."
STR_HYPERWORM_AUTOPSY = "Hyperworm Autopsy"
STR_HYPERWORM_AUTOPSY_INFO = "The Hyperworms' function appears to be little more than feeding. It has powerful jaws and razor sharp teeth designed for ripping and slicing. Its belly appears to be small and the body contains some curious structures containing folds of tough skin. It appears to be quite vulnerable to fire and incendiary ammunition. There is no recognizable brain structure in the Hyperworm and it is well protected from Psionic influence."
STR_CHRYSALIS = "Chrysalis"
STR_CHRYSALIS_INFO = "A Chrysalis is the most vulnerable stage of Alien development because it possesses no attack mechanisms. Its skin is tough, but vulnerable to fire and incendiary ammunition. A new Alien will grow inside the Chrysalis and emerge after a period of three days. It seems that a variety of Alien forms could develop at this stage, dependent on the genetic information carried by the Hyperworm. The physiology of these new forms contains many new cell structures. We have now gained a significant understanding of Alien genetics."
STR_CHRYSALIS_AUTOPSY = "Chrysalis Autopsy"
STR_CHRYSALIS_AUTOPSY_INFO = "The Chrysalis appears to be an important stage in the Alien life cycle. The cell structures we have discovered seem to suggest that the emerging Aliens have a different physiology to those previously encountered. This could indicate that there will be further stages to our biological research. The Chrysalis contains no advanced brain structure and will not respond to Psionic attacks."
STR_ANTHROPOD = "Anthropod"
STR_ANTHROPOD_INFO = "The Anthropod is capable of performing all the actions of an equivalent human soldier and can use weapons and equipment. It can feed voraciously, but strangely it does not seem to live very long in our environment, with a life span of only five days. There seems to be no further stage of development beyond this form."
STR_ANTHROPOD_AUTOPSY = "Anthropod Autopsy"
STR_ANTHROPOD_AUTOPSY_INFO = "This creature was built for warfare, immensely strong and aggressive. Underneath the thick outer skin a significant digestive system is revealed. There is a well protected brain structure that seems to match human size in terms of its neuron count. The well formed brain is vulnerable to Psionic influence although it is not capable of Psionic attacks. This indicates an important weakness of this species. The tissues recovered from this specimen will contribute to our biological warfare research."
STR_PSIMORPH = "Psimorph"
STR_PSIMORPH_INFO = "The Psimorph is a rare and highly specialized Alien. Its Psionic powers and defense are formidable, it is likely to be used as an Alien commander in battle situations. Despite its ability to fly, its mobility is limited due to its bulk and lack of a skeletal structure. Unlike other Alien types it seems to survive quite well in our environment. It represents a serious threat to our Agents. Our best form of defense is with biological weapons and strong Psi-defense."
STR_PSIMORPH_AUTOPSY = "Psimorph Autopsy"
STR_PSIMORPH_AUTOPSY_INFO = "The creature has internal devices that generate an anti-grav field allowing it to float through the air. Without this mechanism the Psimorph would collapse in a mass of jelly-like flesh and tentacles. It has a number of separate brain structures which are extremely well developed indicating potential leadership functions and Psionic capabilities. All of the major organs are duplicated about twelve times which would seem to be a defense mechanism allowing the creature to function despite sustaining massive damage."
STR_SPITTER = "Spitter"
STR_SPITTER_INFO = "This unfortunate creature dedicates its short life to combat and protection of more vulnerable Alien forms. It has limited intelligence and attacks using its funnel head which projects a mix of deadly micro-organisms up to medium range. Despite its humanoid form it is incapable of using other weapons or equipment. It has no eyes, ears or nose but it can accurately detect the presence of nearby organic life forms. This ability is based on a specialized form of Psionic receptor and makes the creature very dangerous in combat situations."
STR_SPITTER_AUTOPSY = "Spitter Autopsy"
STR_SPITTER_AUTOPSY_INFO = "The alarming appearance of the Spitter reflects the fact that this creature's only purpose is to be used in combat. The funnel head propels a liquid containing micro-organisms which secrete acids and enzymes. The large stomach of the creature generates the deadly vomit and would suggest that it sucks up the remains of any victim with its funnel head. With no discernible brain structure this creature is immune from Psionic attacks."
STR_MEGASPAWN = "Megaspawn"
STR_MEGASPAWN_INFO = "It is difficult to disable the Megaspawn's weapon systems because they are an intrinsic part of its structure. One weapon uses energy beams while the other fires a powerful organic missile, which is generated by specialized organs. Our tests also conclude that the Megaspawn is protected from Psionic attacks."
STR_MEGASPAWN_AUTOPSY = "Megaspawn Autopsy"
STR_MEGASPAWN_AUTOPSY_INFO = "The Megaspawn is essentially a huge organic weapons platform. It has two distinct weapons systems grown into its body. Although these must be added artificially, the nervous system is directly connected to them, suggesting that the creature is solely a genetically engineered combat unit."
STR_POPPER = "Popper"
STR_POPPER_INFO = "The Popper runs at high speed towards its victim and explodes when within a range of about fifteen feet. If the Popper is attacked with armor piercing, incendiary or explosive ammunition then the explosive effect is likely to be triggered. We recommend that other forms of weaponry be used against this creature in most combat situations."
STR_POPPER_AUTOPSY = "Popper Autopsy"
STR_POPPER_AUTOPSY_INFO = "The Popper is little more than a walking bomb. Its simple brain structure means that Psionic attacks have a very low chance of success. Its body contains no obvious explosive device, although there are several chemicals mixed into the creatures stomach creating a highly unstable explosive compound."
STR_SKELETOID = "Skeletoid"
STR_SKELETOID_INFO = "The Skeletoid is a highly effective Alien soldier with great intelligence and the ability to fly. Its agile body is capable of withstanding great damage and it can use a variety of weapons and equipment.

STR_MICRONOID_AGGREGATE_AUTOPSY_INFO = "This is not one single creature but billions of micro-organisms. These organisms have been found in the cardiovascular systems of other Aliens, but until now we were unaware of their extraordinary capability to act independently. It is clear that our research must concentrate on these unusual life forms."
STR_QUEENSPAWN = "Queenspawn"
STR_QUEENSPAWN_INFO = "The Alien queen is ultimately the production unit for all Alien life forms. Its mobility is severely limited when fully grown and it also requires exactly the right atmospheric conditions in order to breed properly and produce the Alien eggs. These conditions are only provided by the spawning chambers inside an Alien building, which also provide a food source by plugging directly into the Queenspawn's blood supply. This confirms that the Aliens cannot conquer our dimension without a steady supply of Alien reinforcements through the Dimension Gates, although their motive for such incursions is still unknown."
STR_QUEENSPAWN_AUTOPSY = "Queenspawn Autopsy"
STR_QUEENSPAWN_AUTOPSY_INFO = "The massive form of the Alien queen is designed to lay huge numbers of Alien eggs during its life time.
